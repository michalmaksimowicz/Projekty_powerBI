## Introduction

This dashboard was created for **Job Seekers** to solve a common problem: information about the data job market is scattered and hard to grasp. Using a real-world dataset of 2023-2025 data related job postings (including titles, salaries, and locations), this project provides a single, easy-to-use interface to explore market trends and compensation.

### Dashboard File

You can find the file for the dashboard here: [`Data_Jobs_Dashboard.pbix`](Data_Jobs_Dashboard_1_MM.pbix). ¬†

## Skills Showcased

Here's a look at what I mastered while building this project:

- **‚öôÔ∏è Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.

- **üßÆ Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Yearly Salary` and `Job Count`.

- **üìä Core Charts:** Utilized **Bar, Line,** and **Scatter Chart** to compare job counts, salaries and track trends over time.

- **üó∫Ô∏è Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualize the global distribution of jobs.

- **üî¢ KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards, Gauges** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.

- **üé® Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.

- **üñ±Ô∏è Interactive Reporting:**

    * **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title and Year.

    * **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.

## Dashboard Overview

*This report is split into two distinct pages to provide both a high-level summary and a detailed analysis.*

### Page 1: High-Level Market View

It showcases key KPIs like total job count, median salaries, and top job titles to give you a quick understanding of what's happening in the job market at a glance. There are 2 million job postings in a dataset so filtering by Job Title and Year is added to help you find specific information.

### Page 2: Job Title Drill Through

This is the deep-dive page. From the main dashboard, you can drill through to this view to get specific details for a single job title, including salary ranges, work-from-home, degree and health insurance stats, top hiring platforms, most popular schedule type and a global map of job locations.

## Conclusion

This dashboard showcases how Power BI can transform raw job posting data into a powerful tool for career analysis. It allows users to slice, filter, and drill through data to make informed decisions about their career paths.
